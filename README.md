# Speknife
Speknife is a software for X-ray spectral correction based on the Stripping method. It was developed in Python 3 and does not require any prior knowledge of Python from the user. While it is primarily implemented for CdTe spectrometers, it can be easily modified to work with other spectrometer materials. The package includes two folders:

1- Speknife_Colab 
  This folder is intended for users who prefer to use Google Colab. Users must upload the entire Speknife_Colab folder to their Google Drive and then open the provided Colab notebook to run the corrections. This adaptation of Speknife was created to be user-friendly for individuals who are not familiar with Python, are intimidated by programming, or do not want or cannot install Python 3 on their machine.

  In this version, users will not interact directly with programming code. They only need to modify specific parameters in a text file and click some buttons to execute the corrections. Detailed instructions are available in the documentation. Important: The Speknife_Colab folder must not be placed inside other folders in Google Drive; otherwise, the program will not run!

2- Speknife
  This folder is for users who prefer to run the program locally on their computer. In this case, Python 3 must be installed on the system. This version is designed for users who are comfortable with programming. However, even in this version, no prior knowledge of Python is required; the user only needs to edit an input text file to adjust parameters.
